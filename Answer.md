### Answer 1:
## Relationship between “Product” and “Product_Category” entities:
From the diagram, it appears that each product is associated with a product category through the category_id field in the Product table. This suggests a many-to-one relationship where many products can belong to one category. This is a common relationship in database design, allowing for efficient categorization of products.

### Answer 2:
## Ensuring each product has a valid category:
This can be ensured by implementing foreign key constraints in the database. The category_id field in the Product table should be a foreign key that references the id field in the Product_Category table. This way, the database will ensure that every product must have a valid category id that exists in the Product_Category table.
